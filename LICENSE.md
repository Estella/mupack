 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a utter dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances: outright copyright infringement, selling the original      work with no real work done to it to make a quick buck (especially for some app store) & modding the original work for malware.

 2. If you become rich through decent/considerable modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 let me know. Only a braindead dick would not do that, and not send some compensation my way.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a fucking dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a decent [bug report](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html). I have no patience for people who cannot even do that shit right.
